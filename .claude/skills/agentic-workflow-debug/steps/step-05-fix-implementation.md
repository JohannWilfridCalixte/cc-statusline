# Step 5: Fix Implementation

---

## ORCHESTRATOR ACTION

**You MUST delegate fix implementation using the Task tool. Do NOT implement fixes yourself.**

Fix the root cause, not the symptom. The failing regression test was written in step 4b.

## SEQUENCE

### 5.1 Delegate Fix Implementation

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="
# MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

Read .claude/agents/agentic-agent-software-engineer.md

This file contains your role, skill loading instructions (you MUST use the Skill tool for each skill listed), and output format. Complete ALL setup steps in that file before proceeding.

After setup, confirm: 'Agent file read. Skills loaded. Beginning fix implementation.'

{language_skills_prompt}

# TASK: Implement Fix for Root Cause

Implement the fix for the confirmed root cause.

Workflow: debug (autonomous)
Session ID: {session_id}
Session path: {session_path}
Confirmed hypothesis: {from hypothesis-log}
Investigation log: {session_path}/investigation-log.md
Evidence: {session_path}/evidence.md
Hypothesis log: {session_path}/hypothesis-log.md
Regression test: {session_path}/regression-test-log.md

Your task:
1. Review the FAILING regression test (written by Test Engineer in step 4b)
2. Implement the fix - ONE change addressing root cause
3. Verify the regression test now PASSES
4. Run full test suite to check for no regressions

RULES:
- ONE fix at a time
- No 'while I'm here' improvements
- No bundled refactoring
- Fix at SOURCE, not at symptom point

If implementing defense-in-depth (multiple validation layers), document each layer.

Output to: {session_path}/fix-log.md

Decision log: {session_path}/decision-log.md
")
```

### 5.2 Validate Output

Read `{session_path}/fix-log.md`. Verify it contains:

**Required sections:**
- [ ] Regression Test Verification - test now passes
- [ ] Fix Description - what was changed
- [ ] Full Suite - no regressions
- [ ] Files Changed - list of modified files

### 5.3 Log Fix Decision

```markdown
### DEC-{N}: Fix Implemented

**Step**: fix-implementation
**Agent**: Software Engineer
**Timestamp**: {ISO}

**Context**: Implementing fix for confirmed root cause

**Root cause**: {from hypothesis}
**Fix approach**: {description}
**Files changed**: {count}

**Test results**:
- Regression test: PASS
- Full suite: {PASS/FAIL with count}

**Decision**: Proceed to QA verification

**Confidence**: {%}

**Reversibility**: Easy (git revert)
```

### 5.4 Handle Test Failures

If full test suite fails after fix:

**If unrelated failures:**
Document in decision log, proceed to QA.

**If related failures (fix broke something):**

```markdown
### DEC-{N}: Fix Caused Regressions

**Step**: fix-implementation
**Agent**: Orchestrator
**Timestamp**: {ISO}

**Context**: Fix implementation caused test regressions

**New failures**: {count}
**Analysis**: {related to fix or coincidental}

**Decision**: Re-delegate fix with regression constraint

**Confidence**: {%}
```

Re-delegate to software-engineer with additional constraint:
```
Additional constraint: Your previous fix caused these regressions:
{list of failing tests}

Adjust fix to not break these tests.
```

### 5.5 Complete Step

**Update workflow-state.yaml:**
```yaml
steps_completed:
  - step: 5
    name: "fix-implementation"
    completed_at: {ISO}
    files_changed: {list}
    test_created: true
    suite_passing: {boolean}

artifacts:
  fix_log: "{session_path}/fix-log.md"

current_step: 6
```

**Output:**
```
Fix implemented

Files changed: {count}
Test: Created and passing
Suite: {status}

Proceeding to QA Loop...
```

## FIX LOG TEMPLATE

```markdown
# Fix Log - {session_id}

## Root Cause Summary

{1-2 sentences from confirmed hypothesis}

## Regression Test Verification

**Test location:** {from regression-test-log.md}
**Before fix:** FAILING (as expected)
**After fix:** PASSING

```
{test output showing pass}
```

## Fix Implementation

### Approach

{explain what the fix does and why it addresses root cause}

### Changes

#### {file1}

```diff
{diff showing changes}
```

**Rationale:** {why this change}

#### {file2} (if applicable)

```diff
{diff}
```

### Defense-in-Depth (if applicable)

If multiple validation layers added:

| Layer | Location | Validation |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Entry | {file:line} | {what it checks} |
| Business | {file:line} | {what it checks} |
| Environment | {file:line} | {what it checks} |

## Verification

### Regression Test

```
{test output showing pass}
```

### Full Test Suite

```
{test suite summary - pass/fail counts}
```

### Regressions

- [ ] No new failures
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Files Changed

| File | Change Type |
|------|-------------|
| {file1} | {added/modified/deleted} |
| {file2} | {type} |
```
